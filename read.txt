Great question! Let me explain what I'm planning for Option G: Mother Support Tools and how it affects your system.

  What I'm Planning to Build:

  1. Frontend Components Only (No backend changes needed):

  - ParentTips - Activity-specific tips button with popup guidance
  - ActivityInstructions - Step-by-step guides for each activity
  - DevelopmentGuide - Child development insights by age
  - ParentResources - Parenting articles and resources in Settings

  2. Content Features:

  - Tips for each activity (Letter Hunt, Letter Tracing, Phonics Match, Assessment)
  - Level-specific advice (Beginner vs Advanced Reader)
  - Age-appropriate guidance
  - Discussion questions parents can ask
  - Time estimates and best practices

  Impact on Database & Backend:

  ✅ NO Database Changes Required

  - No new tables needed
  - No migrations needed
  - No new API endpoints needed

  ✅ NO Backend Changes Required

  - All content is static (built into the React components)
  - Tips are hardcoded based on best practices for children's education
  - Similar to how questions.js, learningPlans.js, and rewards.js work

  Why No Backend?

  The parent tips are educational content that doesn't change per user. Like:
  - Questions in your assessment (src/data/questions.js)
  - Learning plans (src/data/learningPlans.js)
  - Badge definitions (src/data/rewards.js)

  These are all static data stored in frontend files, not in the database.

  What Actually Gets Created:

  src/components/
    ├── ParentTips.jsx          (NEW - Tips button with popup)
    ├── ActivityInstructions.jsx (NEW - Step-by-step guides)
    └── DevelopmentGuide.jsx    (NEW - Child development info)

  src/pages/activities/
    ├── LetterHunt.jsx          (MODIFIED - Add ParentTips component)
    ├── LetterTracing.jsx       (MODIFIED - Add ParentTips component)
    └── PhonicsMatch.jsx        (MODIFIED - Add ParentTips component)

  src/pages/
    └── Settings.jsx            (MODIFIED - Add Parent Resources tab)

  Should I Proceed?

  This is a safe operation - it only adds new React components and modifies existing ones. No database or backend changes at all.

  Would you like me to:
  1. Proceed with the implementation as planned
  2. Modify the approach - store tips in backend instead
  3. Do something different

  What would you prefer?
